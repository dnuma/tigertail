# [Tiger Tail Project](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/pizzaeater)
Tiger Tail project: a game inspired with Conestoga's VARLab Bootcamp assets.

You're stuck in a cold moon, with no where to go. You've only snow everywhere and suddenly, astronaut zombies are starting to get drop by some ship that you don't reconize.

Good thing: the zombies weakness is snowballs!!\
Another good thing: you have unlimited ammo!!\
Another good thing: .... no, there's only 2 good things for you in this game.

Shoot the zombies, run away from them, push the gigantic balls to them... do whatever you can to survive. You will die, eventually, but how long can you hold the infinite hordes of astronauts zombies? That's up to you!
