# [Tiger Tail Project](https://dnuma.itch.io/tiger-tail-project)
### Tiger Tail project: a game inspired with Conestoga's VARLab Bootcamp assets.

You're stuck on a cold moon, with nowhere to go. You've only snow everywhere and suddenly, astronaut zombies are starting to get dropped by some ship that you don't recognize.

* Good thing: the zombie's weakness are snowballs!!\
* Another good thing: you have unlimited ammo!!\
* And the best good thing of all: .... no, there are only 2 good things for you in this game.

Shoot the zombies, run away from them, push the gigantic balls to them... do whatever you can to survive. You will die, eventually, but how long can you hold the infinite hordes of astronauts zombies? That's up to you!
